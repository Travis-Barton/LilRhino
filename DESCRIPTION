Version: 0.1.0
Author: Travis Barton (2018) 
Maintainer: Travis Barton <travis.barton@sjsu.edu>
Description: This is for code management functions, a monty hall simulator, and for implementing my own variable reduction technique called Feed Reduction <http://wbbpredictions.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Redditbot_Paper.pdf>. The Feed Reduction technique is not yet published, but is merly a tool for implementing a series of binary neural networks meant for reducing data into N dimensions, where N is the number of possible values of the response variable.
